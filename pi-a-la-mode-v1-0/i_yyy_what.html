<p>hey hye <:Q<Br>

<b>'pi a la mode'</b> is an experimental site based on collective of images 
<br>and texts that I've gathered from differnt people and animated, collaged, 
<br>digitally manipulated them to give the images a different look.  In other 
<br>words I wanted to give a still image some motion.  Also while putting 
<br>this site together I had invisioned  a gallery for my friends and for
<br> my myself as well.  A gallery  to broadcast through the www 
<br>telling the world "we're here."</p>
